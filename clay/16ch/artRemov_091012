% test code to eliminate movement artifact from 16ch data from behaving
% head-restrained animals


% ideas of features that can be used to clip these epochs
% 1.) places where signal is too large (+/-)
% 2.) places where diff(x) is too large (start of artifact)
% 3.) places where diff(x) is too small for a stretch (during artifact)

% try importing RAW file for a channel to test filtering, etc.

ii = 4; % channel number to look at
inFile=[folder filesep basename '.raw.' int2str(ii)];
fi=fopen(inFile,'r','ieee-le');
x2=fread(fi,'float32','ieee-le');
fclose(fi);



% find indices
badInd = find(abs(x2)>0.1);

% find indices where signal gets really big (i.e. artifact)
bigInd = find(abs(x)>1);

% now find beginning and ending indices of artifacts

diffBigInd = diff(bigInd);

find(diffBigInd > 1000)
