% test code to eliminate movement artifact from 16ch data from behaving
% head-restrained animals


% ideas of features that can be used to clip these epochs
% 1.) places where signal is too large (+/-)
% 2.) places where diff(x) is too large (start of artifact)
% 3.) places where diff(x) is too small for a stretch (during artifact)
